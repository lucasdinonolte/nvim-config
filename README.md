# NVIM Config

The goal of this configuration is to be as minimal as possible. While I don't have anything against
plugins per se, I think neovim has come a long way, and a lot of things can be done with what the
editor provides out of the box (like built-in support for LSPs). The only plugins it's installing
is `fzf` for fuzzy finding and `oil` as a better file navigator.
